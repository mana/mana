3) Notes


1. Installing Aethyra and Dependencies
=============================================

Aethyra Debian Package can be installed under the Debian Testing and
Unstable (Sarge/Sid). In order to have Mana Experiment working, you'll need
packages for SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, libxml2, libphysfs and libguichan0.

To install the dependencies, you can do type (as root):

    apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl-image1.2 libxml2 libphysfs-1.0-0

(You'll need to compile libguichan from source since we've moved to 8.1
and there is no package for this as of yet. This could create
problems, any debian users trying this out and giving us fixes
would be much appreciated -- kraant)

Type aethyra as a normal user to play! (Enjoy!)

2. Creating a Debian Package using DebHelper Tools
==================================================

You'll need the gcc, g++ and dev packages of dependencies:

   apt-get install gcc g++ libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev

And the debhelper tools:

   apt-get install dh-make fakeroot dpkg-dev build-essentials

Download tmw from Subversion using the command (You'll need Subversion
installed on your system):

   svn co svn://209.168.213.109/client/trunk aethyra

Rename the aethyra folder into aethyra-XXX and open a console in it.
You can now type:

    fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage

The package will create itself, including sources and diffs. You only need deb
file.

Install it:

    dpkg -i aethyra_XXXXXX_i386.deb

(If you've got a previous one already installed with the same version number,
don't forget to remove it with :)

    apt-get remove aethyra

(Don't worry, you configuration files are not removed...)

And now the final step: type 'aethyra' as a normal user in a shell and you're in!

KDE/GNOME menu entries are created in Arcade Games upon installation.

3. Notes
========

A Debian Repository has been created.

(This repository is for The Mana World not Aethyra, volunteers to make a
package would be nice, basically if you follow these instructions 
you won't get aethyra as of now -- kraant)

Simply add in your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

    deb http://bertram.ifrance.com ./
    deb-src http://bertram.ifrance.com ./

Then, as root, do:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install aethyra

and you're done!

N.B.: The t_me-music, libguichan0, and libguichan0-dev packages are also
provided in this repository.

(Added '_' to avoid picking this file up in grep, fix this later -- kraant)
