Legend:
 [!] Bug fixed (usability issues/visual defects/etc).
 [*] Some changes or misc. stuff.
 [+] Something new.

Version 3 Hello=) from 2025, GoldenDelicious revisited again.

Changes:
 [+] This is port of GoldenDelicious theme to Mana, with help from Thorbjorn.
 [!] Few pixels were shuffled/fixed on window.png vs Version 2.
 [*] zopflipng used on both theme images to reduce size.

Version 2. Five years later I've revisited TMW and randomly crafted
glossy button. So I've got curious how far I can get. The story continues.

Changes:
 [+] Far more complicated and glamourous window title. I like it.
     NB: window title is kind of cheat. It uses slightly incorrect lighting.
     Good luck to notice it though.
 [+] Glass-like buttons FTW. Looks much better. Buttons also look a bit larger.
 [+] Minor color tweaks in few places.
 [+] Some elements size tweaked & some repixeled for better usability.
 [+] Cursors were recolored a bit to better match overall theme.

TODO:
 [*] My hourglass isn't best pixel art ever. Still need something better.
 [*] Progressbars could use bitmaps. This apparently allows superb
     appearance of progressbars. Should give it a try!
 [*] Target "ring" could be more stylish/themed.

Version 0.3. Three years later I've finally spotted obvious bugs.
Changes;
 [!] Fixed items window theming: selected slot had odd appearance.
 [+] Theme now uses different tab title color for channels, should
     help to distinguish between whispers and channels.
 [+] Redrawn checkboxes in hope to improve their appearance.
 [+] Backported highlighted [X] button glow from XFWM4 theme. 
     Took shitload of coordinates fixups and bug hunting.
 [*] Windows had very large titlebars, chopped largest of 'em a bit.
 [*] Misc fixes/improvements for buttons and tabs. Tabs use more
     consistent bit patterns, highlight strengtened a bit. Buttons
     are also using more consistent patterns, bevels are less bright
     and pressing buttons are a bit more convincing since bit patterns
     now also move accordingly.
 [*] Buttons of drop-downs repix'd to look better (they were too small).


Version 0.2. Reworked lot stuff and recolored a bit. 
Load of "new" ManaPlus compatibility improvements.

Note: this verion of theme tested only on latest ManaPlus.
(Code from 12.12.2013 or later)

Changes:
 [!] Fixed black-on-black color issue in help window. Thanks to 4144!
     Caveat: new manaplus haves another idea about this as it 
     has been bug. Anyway, help should be readable on both "old" 
     and "new" manaplus.
 [!] Reduced artefacts caused by window bitmap texture due to tiling.
 [!] Fixed color of item protection background in shop windows.
 [!] Fixed keyboard icon coloring.
 [!] Fixed joystick frame appearance.
 [!] Fixed joystick arrows invisible on some maps (jewelry bug!).
 [!] Fixed quest log icons to match theme.
 [!] Fixed theming of on-screen touch buttons.
 [!] Fixed black-on-black connection progress - own progress indicator
     (fairly dumb attempt to draw hourglass, looks okay though).
 [+] Now since new manaplus supports OLDCHAT color, my theme uses it. 
 [+] Using *_BAR, *_BAR_OUTLINE text coloring on bars.
 [+] Using "new" ManaPlus color for old chat text (loaded on startup).
 [*] Tweaked window colors, using slightly different approach to do
     texturing. Overall, windows are now looking better to my taste.
 [*] Reworked window titlebar to have rounded corners.
 [*] Same for chat tabs.
 [*] Some small changes reducing overall theme contrast a bit.
 [*] Tweaked padding of shortcuts bar, looks better as 1-column window.
     Note: maybe only works well with recent manaplus.
 [*] Some messing with padding of windows and buttons to make 
     theme a bit more compact overall.
 [*] Improved cursor selection in items dialog so it no longer overlaps
     items most of time. 
  
TODO: Still some things to chew on.
 [*] Some ironing out of colors probably required (HELP, bars, etc)
 [*] More attention to antialiasing on tabs?

Version 0.03 pre-alpha. Quick fix of dumb bug.
Changes:
 [!] Fixed chat color selection dropdown/listbox colors.
     Everything else is untouched.

Version 0.02 pre-alpha. First public version.
Changes:
 [*] Shortcuts bar tweaked. Smaller padding, item boxes re-centered,
     borders reduced. Still not perfect.
 [*] Recolored text on bars to match rest of theme.
 [!] Fixed offline chat tabs coloring.
 [!] Online list coloring is at least acceptable (fixed default color,
     guild/party coloring, self). 
 [*] Optipng applied for all PNGs after editing considered to be done :)

Known issues:
 [*] Shortcuts bar somewhat wide to my taste and wastes screen space.
     Attempt to fix this has been only partial success.
 [*] Same goes for other elements as well. So I would not recommend
     this theme for phones and somesuch.
 [*] Colors of MP/HP/... bars aren't perfect.
 [*] Help browserbox colors are bad. Attempts to work it around isn't
     huge success so far. [s]But who reads help, anyway?[/s] 
 [*] In Setup window, player relations table header looks ugly due
     to hardcoded color. It has been fixed by 4144. In new version
     of ManaPlus this will be okay (tested!).
 [*] Lock button of chat appears below scroll button in chat if there're
     too many tabs. Yet this issue presents on other themes as well.
     Not sure if theme could work it around or not.
 [*] Appearance of disabled tabs and disabled checkboxes 
     was not tested since I don't know

TODO:
 [*] Fix that damn shortcuts bar completely. For some reasons window 
     would not resize smaller than certain size, this thwarts efforts
     to reduce padding as there is huge border at right due to inability 
     to resize window smaller than certain size. Maybe something 
     hardcoded in client?
 [*] Help browserbox text colors should be fixed. 
     It's hard to read black-on-black!
 [*] Try to reduce paddings/spacings for other widgets/windows/etc.
 [*] Maybe rework F4 equipment window? Looks quite okay with some 
     remaining things from Jewelry, but probably appearance could be
     improved further? Already looks okay though.

Version 0.01 pre-alpha. First try to make theme.
 Based on Jewelry from Hal9000.  Load of bug and wasn't released. 
 Some bugfixes were based on feedback from screenshots :P.
