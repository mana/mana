##3MOUSE:

Left click to execute default action: walk, pick up an item, attack a monster
and talk to NPCs.  Right click to show up a context menu.


##3COMMUNICATION:

Communication is often essential to success in this game. You can communicate
in several ways:  By chatting and showing emotions (see above), by trading
(with the right-click context menu), and by whispering.

To whisper, type

##2  /whisper <name> <message>

 This will send <message> to player <name>, if that player is logged in. If the
 name has a space in it, put double quotes around it like this:

##2  /whisper "<name>" <message>

For further help type /help in the chat console.


##3IGNORING COMMUNICATION

You may find that not all communication is to your liking.  While most people
are nice, some may offend you or try to make your life harder. Since this is
an open game, there is nothing the developers can do to prevent this.

However, you can protect yourself from such players by ignoring them.  Right-
click on them to bring up the context menu, then select `Ignore´ or
`Disregard´ (see below).  You can fine-tune your player relations in the
`Setup´ menu, which lists all the players you have added to it.  To open this
menu, select `Setup´ in the upper right corner of the screen, then `Players´.

There you will find a list of all players you are acquainted with, as well as
several configuration options:

- allow trading:  Do you wish to allow trade requests from arbitrary players?
- allow whispers:  Do you wish to allow arbitrary players to send
  private messages to you in-game?


##3THE PLAYER LIST

The player list lists all of your acquaintances. They are categorised as one
of the following:

- ##2neutral##0:  As far as the game is concerned, this is the same as not
  having the player listed:  the player may chat with you, but may only trade
  or whisper if you have this option allowed for everyone.
- ##2friend##0:  You consider this player a friend.  The player may chat,
  message your in private, or trade with you at any point.
- ##2disregarded##0:  You wish to disregard this player, meaning that his or
  her trade requests and whispers are ignored.
- ##2ignored##0:  You wish to completely ignore this player.  You will not
  even see emotions for him or her anymore.
