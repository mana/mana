##2Mana##0 is a serious effort to create an innovative free and open
source MMORPG Client. Mana uses 2D graphics and aims to create a large
and diverse interactive world. It is licensed under the GPL, making
sure this game can't ever run away from you.

The project includes the development of both a client and a server.
Others are making worlds using Mana software. The Mana World project
is the originator of the Mana project. Mana was split off to further
facilitate development of other worlds.
