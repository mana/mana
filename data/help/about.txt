##3                      === ABOUT MANA ===
 
 ##2Mana##P is a serious effort to create an innovative free and open
 source MMORPG Client. Mana uses 2D graphics and aims to create a large
 and diverse interactive world. It is licensed under the GPL, making
 sure this game can't ever run away from you.
 
 The project includes the development of both a client and a server.
 Others are making worlds using Mana software. The Mana World project
 is the originator of the Mana project. Mana was split off to further
 facilitate development of other worlds.
