1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out Mana from Git or you have downloaded
a source release. To get Mana to compile, you need a compiler (GCC)
and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL2              https://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL2_mixer        https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer
* SDL2_image        https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image
* SDL2_net          https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net
* SDL2_ttf          https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf
* ENet 1.3          http://sauerbraten.org/enet/ (included in repository)
* Guichan 0.8.x     https://github.com/darkbitsorg/guichan
* libxml2           https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/wikis/home
* physfs 2.x        https://icculus.org/physfs/
* zlib 1.2.x        https://zlib.net/
* libcurl           https://curl.se/libcurl/

If you've cloned the Git repository, you will also need these tools to compile:

* CMake >= 3.8      https://cmake.org/
* GNU gettext       https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

On some machines, it's been reported that this package is also needed. However,
you might not need it:

* GNU libtool       https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing Mana
================================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) Run "cmake ."
3) Run "make"
4) Run "make install" as root

It should have installed Mana on your system now, and you can run it
with "mana". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can pass a
different prefix to cmake with -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix


  NOTE: It is possible to compile Mana without support for OpenGL rendering.
  To do this perform step 2 as follows:

    cmake -DWITH_OPENGL=OFF .

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".

For additional CMake related hints please read README.cmake
